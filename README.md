# Project : Synthesizer

Project "Synthesizer" extends the sound synthesizer code that have been developed previously into a more full featured digital synthesizer. I have implemented several additional features for the synthesizer, more closely approximating the features found in analog synthesizers such as the Korg Minilogue or the Moog Matriarch. <br>

The project focused on the use of vectors (data structure) and recursion (algorithm) to create wave sounds, which can be used to make background effects for some music composition. <br>

Please download the extension Scamper on VS Code to run this file. Thank you! <br>
